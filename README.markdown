DM Sinatra Security
================

A (really) dirty stab at trying to get Cyril David's sinatra security gem to work with DataMapper.

Works pretty much the same way by doing include Sinatra::Security::User in your user class.

Also I don't know shit about tests so the tests don't probably work - I've only tested manually in the browser.

I'd appreciate any help in cleaning this up. Hey I'm a fucking designer ok? Cut me some slack.
